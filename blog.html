      <h2 class="title">How Being a Woman Has Changed My Life</h2>
      <h4>July 13, 2021</h4>
      <p class="blog">For years I have always had a social disadvantage, ranging from issues such as having to be extra cautious at night to not realizing the full extent of my capabilities. Growing up, I was conditioned with the societal narrative of sexism; boys were associated with blue, girls with pink, boys played with monster trucks while girls played with dolls, the list goes on. But most importantly, I was taught that I could never pursue a career in STEM simply because I was a woman. In fact, I was encouraged to become either a chef or a fashion designer! It wasn't until I became old enough to think for my own that I started to realize how disproportionate and outdated such stereotypes are.</p>
      <p class="blog">Since then, I have become determined to break these horrendous concepts that were put in place by mostly men and show the world that women are capable of taking on challenging career paths. No more should women be expected to always manage and maintain the household while men go to their dream jobs and build a successful future for themselves and their descendants.</p>
      <p class="blog">I've always considered how the world would be if women weren't conditioned to stay silent and repressed for their entire lives. How would this have an impact on not just the economy and society, but on humanity as a whole? While contemplating this question, I realized all of what I like to call the "silent oppressors" that exist in our lives. Things that exist to further disadvantage women, yet are often not changed. Think about menstrual products and how women receive them. The menstrual cycle is a natural cycle that can only be intercepted if a woman becomes pregnant, yet we need to buy menstrual products without a lower tax, or even being able to receive them for free. This is a reason why period poverty is an ongoing issue in the world. A lot of the time, period poverty is overlooked or unheard of in different parts of the world. But, why is that the case? This goes back to my original theory of a silent oppressor; there's no valid reason why access to proper menstrual products shouldn't be free. Rather, it is a problem that some people believe will "resolve itself", meaning the general public does nothing to fix this issue, saying that lawmakers will change this eventually.</p>
      <p class="blog">This all ties back to women being continuously oppressed in different ways that some people in privilege have never heard of before. It's one of the main reasons why there is a limited amount of women in STEM-related careers; we've been so conditioned into believing that we could never be a part of STEM because that's what society has taught us. Thankfully, the rising generation of women are starting to break the cycle and prove to the world how they're more than capable of working for NASA or developing and coding their very own programs and projects. As time goes on, there will be a world that exists with little to no sexism, where every woman can achieve their dream goals by going into a STEM-related career, if they choose to do so. When that time has come, we will know that humanity has succeeded in eradicating outdated stereotypes about women for good.</p>
