      <!-- Adding text and an image about some of the activities I'm involved in -->
      <p> On the weekends, I go to a nearby outdoor range and practice archery. I've been doing archery for about 9 years now and have been shooting with a recurve bow. I can also bake some really good sugarcookies my grandma taught me!</p>

      <img class="archery" src="assets/2018.06.jpg" alt="A picture of me practicing archery in an indoor space. There is an assortment of foam targets lined up on the sides next to the walls of the room. I am standing towards the center of the room in the middle of shooting my recurve bow at a target towards the very back wall of the room.">

      <p>Recently, <a href="https://lily-glewans-personality-quiz.lilyglew.repl.co/" alt="A link to the quiz I coded." target="_blank">I coded a Buzzfeed-esque quiz</a> using the properties of HTML, CSS, and most importantly, JavaScript. In this quiz, the user will answer a series of questions based on the type of snacks they prefer at the movie theater. Then, based on their choices, the browser will return a streaming site the user's personality best matches. Although it took me a while to complete, I am really proud of the end result!</p>
      
      <!-- Including an accessible link to my school's robotics team -->
      <p>I am also one of the leads for the robotics team at my high school. You can learn more about the team on <a href="https://www.montclairrobotics.org/" alt="link to the Montclair Robotics website." target="_blank">the official Montclair Robotics Team 555 website.</a> Recently, we worked on a project known as REACH (Revolutionized Electronic Arm-Chair for Healthcare). This project focused on building an omni-directional wheelchair to assist a local Wounded Warrior.</p>

      <!-- Ambassador info at Saturn -->
      <p>During each school year, I am an ambassador for <a href="https://www.joinsaturn.com/" alt="link to Saturn's website." target="_blank">Saturn</a>, an app on both desktop and mobile that helps high schoolers keep track of both their assignments and schedules. Being a part of Saturn has been game-changing for me, and the team over at Saturn are like a second-family!</p>

      <img id="saturn" src="assets/saturn amb.jpg" alt= "An image of an astronaut in space next to the planet Saturn. The picture is in black and white and the Saturn app's logo is pictured on the astrounat's helmet. In the top left corner, the word ambassador is printed in big font, and in the top right corner a gold crown, which is commonly used to refer to the ambassadors, is pictured."
