   <!-- Main blurb about me -->
    <main id="about">
    <p>Hi! My name is Lily Glewan (pronouns: she/her). My favorite movie is Black Panther mainly because of the cinematography and music used, and also since its plot is primarily based upon future technology that can benefit humanity in countless different ways. During my free time when I'm not tackling robotics and school, I like to read and hone in on my video editing skills by using programs such as Adobe After Effects. I am also an avid social justice advocate and take multiple social justice classes that are offered at my school.</p>
    <p class="moreSpace">My plans for the future can be best described as ambitious. After attending a university mainly oriented towards technology (i.e. MIT, Georgia Tech, etc.), I plan on becoming the first CEO of Apple that identifies as a Muslim woman.</p>
